# Chris Holdgraf - about me

Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I work at the intersection of technical development, open communities, scientific research, and education.

I also help run [2i2c - the International Interactive Computing Collaboration](https://2i2c.org), a non-profit dedicated to open source infrastructure for interactive computing in research and education.

I work with teams to create and improve open-source technology for scientists, educators, and data analysts. My goal is to help people do their work more effectively, openly, inclusively, and reproducibly.

You can learn a bit more about what I do on this website.
