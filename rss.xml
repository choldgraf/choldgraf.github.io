      <link>http://chrisholdgraf.com/blog/2018/devopsdays-sv-2018</link>
      <description>


Last week I took a few days to attend [DevOpsDays Silicon Valley](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2018-silicon-valley/program/). My goal
was to learn a bit about how the DevOps culture works, what are the things
people are excited about and discuss in this community. I'm also interested in
learning a thing or two that could be brought back into</description>

      <title>Blogging with Jupyter Notebooks and Jekyll using nbconvert templates</title>
      <link>http://chrisholdgraf.com/blog/2018/jekyllmarkdown</link>
      <description>


Here's a quick (and hopefully helpful) post for those wishing to blog in
Jekyll using Jupyter notebooks. As some of you may know, `nbconvert` can
easily convert your `.ipynb` files to markdown, which Jekyll can easily
turn into blog posts for you.

```
nbconvert --to markdown myfile.ipynb
```

However, an annoying part of this is that Markdown</description>

[Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) is a fantastic way to build
documentation for your Python package. On the Jupyter project, we use it
for almost all of our repositories.

Recently I've been reading up on governance models for several large-ish open
source projects. This is partially because I'm involved in a bunch of
these projects myself, and partially because it's fascinating to see distributed groups
of people organizing themselves in effective (or not) ways on the internet.

      <link>http://chrisholdgraf.com/blog/2018/kinds-of-openness</link>
      <description>


How do open projects signal their "openness" to the outside community? This is
a really hard question, particularly because nowadays "open" has become a buzzword
that doesn't just signal a project's position to the community, but is also used
as a marketing term to increase support, users, or resources.

      <description>


As I've written about before, I [like Rust's governance structure](https://chrisholdgraf.com/rust-governance).
I mean, who can't get behind a community that
[lists governance as a top-level page on its website](https://www.rust-lang.org/governance)?

Jupyter is currently in the middle of
[figuring out the next phase of its governance structure](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/governance-office-hours-meeting-minutes/1480/26),
and so I have been thinking about
what this might look like.</description>

I often run shell commands in Python via the [`subprocess.run` command](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.run).
One thing that has always bugged me is that this required you to split commands into a list before it'd work properly.
For example, you'd have to do:

```python
import subprocess
import shlex

subprocess.run(*shlex.split("ls -l"))
```

Today I discovered that you don't have to do this!

As part of [my `sphinx-social-previews`](https://github.com/choldgraf/sphinx-social-previews) prototype, I wanted to be able to use the [Roboto Font from Google](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) in image previews.
However, Roboto is often not loaded on your local filesystem, so it took some digging to figure out how to make it possible to load via [Matplotlib's text plotting functionality](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.text.html).

I recently attended [the JupyterLite community workshop in Paris](https://blog.jupyter.org/community-workshop-jupyterlite-e992c61f5d7f?source=collection_home---6------6-----------------------), here are some quick thoughts from the three-day event[^ack].

This is a short post to demonstrate how to install packages directly from GitHub with `pyprojects.toml` or `requirements.txt`, including custom branches and commits.
It will focus on `pyprojects.toml` because this is newer and there's less information about it, but the general pattern holds for `requirements.txt` as well.

In `pyproject.toml`, you can specify</description>

      <title>Bundle extensions with your Sphinx theme</title>
      <link>http://chrisholdgraf.com/blog/2023/sphinx-add-extensions</link>
      <description>


Sphinx is great because it has a ton of useful extensions that let you grow its functionality.
However, a downside of this is that users have to actually _learn about_ those extensions and activate them manually.
It's not hard, but it's a non-trivial amount of discovery work.

One way to solve this is</description>

      <title>Report from FOSDEM23: beautiful chaos in a conference</title>

I recently attended [FOSDEM 2023](https://fosdem.org/2023/), my first FOSDEM!
I had heard of the conference before, but hadn't really looked into it too much.
Fortunately, after some urging from friends and social media, I took a deeper look and decided I should join to see what all the fuss was about.

I've since moved my blog to use [the MyST Document Engine](https://mystmd.org) so this example will no longer work on my personal blog.

Wow it has been a long time since I've last-written here. It turns out that having two small children and a very demanding job means you don't have as much time for blogging. But that's a whole different blog post...

      <title>Generate MyST with Jupyter and insert it into content programmatically</title>

      <description>



While I've been [converting my blog to use the new MyST engine](./mystmd-with-the-blog.md), I discovered a useful MyST feature. It's not yet possible to [natively parse Jupyter Markdown outputs as MyST](https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd/issues/1026) but there's a workaround if you don't mind generating a temporary file.

The trick is to _write to a temporary file_</description>

On my journey to learn more about writing with [the new MyST engine](https:///mystmd.org), I built upon [my recent update to my blog infrastructure](./programmatic-myst-with-jupyter.md) and made some improvements to my blog post list.
