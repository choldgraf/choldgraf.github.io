A few quick ideas for doing this:</p><ul><li><strong>At first, treat yourself as a visitor</strong>. It will take time to build understanding, status, and trust within a community. Until that happens, it’s important to meet open source communities as peers and consider yourself a visitor. Listen, learn, engage, and adapt your behavior to that of the community. Don’t assume that you should have any special status because you’re a large or well-known organization.</li><li><strong>Participate in community spaces</strong>. The easiest way to learn how a community operates is to participate in the online spaces where it operates. If there are community meetings, attend them and introduce yourself. If the community has a forum, show up and say hello. If the community uses GitHub issues, watch for what kinds of things people discuss. Offer help, advise, and guidance wherever you can. This will help you understand the needs and direction of the project.</li><li><strong>Abide by community culture</strong>. For many communities, a lot of care and thought is put into building community dynamics that are open, inclusive, deliberate, and that balance power across the many stakeholders in the ecosystem. It is crucial that you abide by these cultural dynamics, especially with respect to things like Code of Conduct and interpersonal interactions. Taking this time to understand the culture will make the experience much more pleasant for everybody involved.</li><li><strong>Respect the community priorities</strong>. Many organizations reach out only at the moment where they <em>need</em> something. This is understandable, but a very inefficient way of getting things done in open source communities. There are a variety of needs, priorities, and interests in the community. You should begin by understanding what these are and finding ways to engage with them before focusing on your own priorities or asking for (or offering) changes to suit your needs. The trust that comes from helping someone <em>else</em> with their problem will make it much easier for you to get your own issues fixed in the future.</li><li><strong>Accept that things will move more slowly</strong>. I know that you have a product or a feature to ship, and that you want to make rapid progress. But, open source communities generally are (and generally should be) slower and more deliberate in their decision-making than many organizations are used-to. Slowing things down ensures that a diverse collection of voices have an opportunity to weigh in on questions, and keeps the community more inclusive and participatory. It also often leads to better decisions that take into consideration more perspectives.</li></ul><p>After you spend some time engaging with open source communities, there are a few concrete steps you can take towards making contributions.

This is much easier if you do so after interacting with the community for a bit, as you will understand its priorities, as well as the underlying codebase, enough to be more efficient and productive.</p><p>Take a look at the issues or roadmap of a project and find ones that you’d also benefit from, chime in and mention that you’d like to try and make these changes to see if others are excited about it. Then, follow-through and engage with the community as you make changes. Don’t be resistant to feedback - remember that you are a part of a broader community with its own norms and expectations around code style, structure, etc.</p><aside class="my-5 shadow-md dark:shadow-2xl dark:shadow-neutral-900 bg-gray-50/10 dark:bg-stone-800 overflow-hidden rounded border-l-4 border-green-600 tip"><div class="m-0 font-medium py-1 flex min-w-0 text-lg text-green-600 bg-green-50 dark:bg-slate-900"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" data-slot="icon" width="2rem" height="2rem" class="inline-block pl-2 mr-2 self-center flex-none text-green-600"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="m16.862 4.487 1.687-1.688a1.875 1.875 0 1 1 2.652 2.652L10.582 16.07a4.5 4.5 0 0 1-1.897 1.13L6 18l.8-2.685a4.5 4.5 0 0 1 1.13-1.897l8.932-8.931Zm0 0L19.5 7.125M18 14v4.75A2.25 2.25 0 0 1 15.75 21H5.25A2.25 2.25 0 0 1 3 18.75V8.25A2.25 2.25 0 0 1 5.25 6H10"></path></svg><div class="text-neutral-900 dark:text-white grow self-center overflow-hidden break-words">Example: Look for 👍 in issues</div></div><div class="px-4 py-1"><p>The Executable Books Project has <a target="_blank" href="https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/feature-vote.html" rel="noreferrer">a feature voting leaderboard</a> that it uses to let users vote with a 👍.
