a new governance model in the Python community, following the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-8000/" class="">PEP 8000 series</a>
of enhancement proposals.</p><p>There were a lot of interesting ideas in the proposals that came forward, but this
post is going to focus on the one that ended up being chosen, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-8016/" class="">PEP 8016</a>. You can find the final language of Python’s governance model <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0013/" class="">in this PEP</a>.</p><p>So, what would Python’s governance model look like in Jupyter?</p><h2 id="a-quick-overview" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">A quick overview</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#a-quick-overview" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h2><p>At a high level, Python’s governance model is quite similar to that of Project Jupyter.
It has two main bodies:</p><ul><li><p>A steering council</p></li><li><p>A “core contributors” group</p></li></ul><p>The steering council has the “final say” in everything within the Python language, though
they also have a mandate to delegate as much as possible to teams / groups within the
Python community. As such, most decisions will likely <em>not</em> be made by the steering council.
Membership on the council is determined on a rotating basis, and a new council is elected before
each new major release of Python. This ensures continuity in the council, but also ensures
that there are opportunities for membership to evolve over time. Discussion and design
for decisions are made via the Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) process, though the
“decision” on these PEPs can take different forms (and the council has the ultimate vote
if need be).</p><p>In many ways, this closely resembles what the Jupyter project already has.
Jupyter uses a steering council to make decisions, though the council is much larger
(at 21 members). It also has a large, informally defined group of “core contributors”,
which maps cleanly onto the Python “core team” model. Python already has a
well-established collective decision-making process (PEPs), while Jupyter
has a defined-but-not-established process (JEPs).</p><h2 id="a-jupyter-pep-013" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">A Jupyter PEP 013</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#a-jupyter-pep-013" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h2><p>The rest of this post is going to be a close mirror to the accepted <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0013/" class="">PEP 013 proposal</a>.

map onto whatever structures currently exist in the Jupyter world.</p><h3 id="the-current-jupyter-steering-council" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">The current Jupyter steering council</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#the-current-jupyter-steering-council" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h3><p>The current steering council is the only official group of people attached to

a solid track record of being constructive and helpful
significant contributions to the project’s goals, in any form
willingness to dedicate some time to improving Jupyter
As the project matures, contributions go beyond code. Here’s an incomplete list of areas where contributions may be considered for joining the core team, in no particular order:</p><ul><li><p>Working on community management and outreach</p></li><li><p>Providing support on the mailing lists, gitter rooms, and the community forum</p></li><li><p>Triaging tickets</p></li><li><p>Writing patches (code, docs, or tests)</p></li><li><p>Reviewing patches (code, docs, or tests)</p></li><li><p>Participating in design decisions</p></li><li><p>Providing expertise in a particular domain (security, i18n, etc.)</p></li><li><p>Managing the continuous integration infrastructure</p></li><li><p>Managing the servers (website, tracker, documentation, etc.)</p></li><li><p>Maintaining related projects (alternative interpreters, core infrastructure like packaging, etc.)</p></li><li><p>Creating visual designs</p></li></ul><p>Core team membership acknowledges sustained and valuable efforts that align well with the philosophy and the goals of the Jupyter project.</p><p>It is granted by receiving at least two-thirds positive votes in a core team vote that is open for one week and with no veto by the steering council.</p><p>Core team members are always looking for promising contributors, teaching them how the project is managed, and submitting their names to the core team’s vote when they’re ready.</p><p>There’s no time limit on core team membership. However, in order to provide the general public with a reasonable idea of how many people maintain Jupyter, core team members who have stopped contributing are encouraged to declare themselves as “inactive”. Those who haven’t made any non-trivial contribution in two years may be asked to move themselves to this category, and moved there if they don’t respond. To record and honor their contributions, inactive team members will continue to be listed alongside active core team members; and, if they later resume contributing, they can switch back to active status at will. While someone is in inactive status, though, they lose their active privileges like voting or nominating for the steering council, and commit access.</p><p>The initial active core team members will consist of everyone with commit access to one of the Jupyter core repositories on Github.</p><h3 id="changing-this-document" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Changing this document</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#changing-this-document" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h3><p>Changes to this document require at least a two-thirds majority of votes cast in a core team vote which should be open for two weeks.</p><h2 id="whats-different-between-python-and-jupyter" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">What’s different between Python and Jupyter?</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#whats-different-between-python-and-jupyter" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h2><p>I was struck by how similar the new Python governance model is to
the Jupyter project’s current model. They both have a steering council approach,
and a core team that surrounds it. That means that Jupyter could get pretty close
by effectively doing these three things:</p><ul><li><p>Reduce the steering council from 21 to 5 people</p></li><li><p>Formalize the “core team” to be current Jupyter committers</p></li><li><p>Codify and enforce the JEP process for discussion and decision-making</p></li></ul><p>That said, there are a few ways in which I think Python and Jupyter are different.
Jupyter feels like it has more moving pieces across different parts of the stack. It has “core projects” that span everything from kernel specifications
to user interfaces to cloud infrastructure. It also feels like Jupyter is more OK with
“bleeding edge” software and quick release cycles (though this depends on the project,
the notebook has been pretty stable for a while now).</p><p>Perhaps the first thing that a new Jupyter steering council should do is to create several
sub-steering councils (maybe sub-“teams”) that serve in a steering-council-like role
but for a specific project (like jupyterhub, jupyterlab, the jupyter notebook specification, etc).
These could serve similarly to the sub-teams in the Rust community as well.</p><p>Another benefit of this model is that it doesn’t require a drastic shift from our
current governance. It’s more of a refinement and commitment to processes that we
already know about but rarely follow strictly.</p><p>In all, the Python model seems like a nice balance between the organized chaos of
a totally collective decision-making process, and the high-stress-and-bottlenecking
approach of a BDFL-style model.</p><div></div><div class="flex pt-10 mb-10 space-x-4"><a class="flex-1 block p-4 font-normal text-gray-600 no-underline border border-gray-200 rounded shadow-sm group
