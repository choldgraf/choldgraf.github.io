# A few recent talks

Lately I've given quite a number of talks about the Jupyter and Binder
ecosystems for various purposes. Before each of the talks, I make the
slides available at a public address in case others are interested in
following up with the material. For those who missed the talks (or the
subsequent tweets about them), here are a few of the more recent ones.

A word of warning: there's a lot of overlap between these talks - I'm not
crazy enough to re-invent the wheel each time I have to speak. However, maybe
folks will find some value in the different angles taken in each case.

## The Berkeley Data 8 Stack (60 min)

This talk covers some of the technical infrastructure behind the pedagogical
efforts here at UC Berkeley. It's a brief dive into JupyterHub distributions
and how they fit into an institution like UC Berkeley.

## Open infrastructure for open science (5 min)

This one was a quick overview of the Binder ecosystem for a community focused
mostly around reproducibility and publishing. Lots of action-items in here :-)

## Reproducibility with Binder @ ASM

This covers the Binder Project and the tools that it creates for open, reproducible
science. It was geared towards a less-technical audience than many of the
conferences I normally speak at. It covers more of a users' perspective of mybinder.org,
and how this might fit into reproducible publishing.

## Reproducibility with Binder @ UW Reproducibility workshop

This talk goes into more depth on the technical side of the reproducibility efforts
with Jupyter and Binder. It was given in the context of a [two-day workshop on
reproducible environments and publishing](https://escience.washington.edu/writing-reproducible-executable-scientific-papers-with-r-python-a-hands-on-workshop/).

## Binder in the cloud @ csvconf

A broad overview of the Binder ecosystem and the technical stack that lies
underneath it, as well as a short aside on the composable, modular approach
that Jupyter takes towards building these tools

## Jupyter Book @ Strada

An overview of the [jupyter book project](https://jupyter.org/jupyter-book). This
covers the technical stack behind the tool that converts collections of
Jupyter Noteoboks into an HTML website book.
