Here’s a point that originally surprised me when I heard it:</p><blockquote><p>Most foundations within the Linux Foundation network recommend <strong>against</strong> using foundation resources for software development. Instead they recommend funding <em>systems that lead to more and better development from volunteer contributions</em>.</p></blockquote><p>This was counter-intuitive to me at first, and I think may be counter-intuitive to others as well, so I wanted to share how I think about this.</p><h2 id="the-core-thesis-of-open-source-is-that-participatory-development-leads-to-the-best-products" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">The core thesis of open source is that participatory development leads to the best products</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#the-core-thesis-of-open-source-is-that-participatory-development-leads-to-the-best-products" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h2><p>At its core, open source development models rest on a belief that <strong>you’ll build something better, in the long run, if you give many different people the opportunity to co-create and co-lead together</strong>. This is in contrast to models where you centralize the vision, roadmap, and development with a single organization.<span id="fnref-bDKaYRDHgd" class="" data-state="closed"><sup class="hover-link"><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit font-normal hover:underline" href="#fn-os" title="Link to Footnote" aria-label="Link to Footnote">[<!-- -->1<!-- -->]</a></sup></span></p><p>To me, this is <em>the most important part of open source</em>, and something projects must lean into.

As projects grow in size, they grow their technical and social complexity at an incredible rate. The challenge is no longer writing code, it’s <strong>organizing teams of volunteer contributors to write the right code in a dependable and sustainable way</strong>. These are <em>social problems</em>, not technical problems. For example:</p><ul><li><p>How do you set a collective vision and strategy when you have 5, 10, 50, 100 people without a formal hierarchy?</p></li><li><p>How do you pay down technical debt when major components of a project have been written by people with different technical philosophies?</p></li><li><p>How do you align teams on a roadmap of development priorities when they’re all working remotely and on volunteer time?</p></li><li><p>How do you spread the burden of maintenance and development when only one or two maintainers understand the codebase?</p></li><li><p>How do you hold people accountable for working on the team’s priorities when everyone is a volunteer?</p></li></ul><p>These problems only get worse and worse as projects grow. And <strong>this is a huge risks to stakeholders that want to depend on an open source project</strong>. If I run a product team at a company, I use open source in-part because I have the ability to influence and improve the technology I depend on. If there’s no reliable way for me to learn about a project’s goals and participate in its development processes, it loses a lot of its core open source value as a project, and may be a liability as a dependency.</p><h2 id="foundations-should-fund-the-hard-parts-since-they-need-expertise-and-dedicated-time" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Foundations should fund the hard parts since they need expertise and dedicated time</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#foundations-should-fund-the-hard-parts-since-they-need-expertise-and-dedicated-time" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h2><p>For this reason, foundations use their resources to <em>fund a system that leads to better, more productive co-creation</em>. This makes it easier for others to participate in the project, to set a shared direction, and to get things done reliably. It leans into the core strategy of a big open source project.</p><p>For example, this might include roles and work like:</p><ul><li><p>Fund roles that align open source projects on what they <em>want to develop</em>.</p></li><li><p>Fund roles that spread knowledge so that there aren’t silos of information and skills.</p></li><li><p>Fund roles that give guidance to contributors so that there’s coherence to technical implementation across the project.</p></li><li><p>Fund roles that <em>solve problems for technical contributors on the project</em> rather than doing technical contributions for them.</p></li><li><p>Fund roles that help marketing and sales of the foundation, so that it has more resources to fund the above roles.</p></li></ul><h2 id="this-will-make-it-easier-for-ecosystems-of-contributors-to-grow" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">This will make it easier for ecosystems of contributors to grow</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#this-will-make-it-easier-for-ecosystems-of-contributors-to-grow" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h2><p>If you fund systems like this, it will be easier for many stakeholders to participate in an open source ecosystem. These might be individuals, companies, university teams, etc. They’ll all have different motivations and interests - some may be building internal products, some will be scratching an itch, some will be selling consulting contracts.</p><p>Crucially, they’ll all need a <em>system</em> that directs their energy in the right direction, and provides the guidance necessary for them to make a helpful contribution. That system is the thing that foundations want to fund.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, foundations <em>do care about writing code</em> - that’s the whole point of most open source project. However, funding development work directly cuts against your main thesis that software development can be done collaboratively by a community, and not just by dedicated staff. For this reason, I’ve come around to the idea that foundations should use their resources to grow a contributor ecosystem rather than develop code directly. It’s the funding approach that leans into what open source is supposed to be all about.</p><h2 id="appendix-exceptions-to-this-strategy" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Appendix: Exceptions to this strategy</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#appendix-exceptions-to-this-strategy" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h2><p>I’ve heard of a few exceptions to this strategy that are worth noting. Here are the cases where I’ve seen foundations directly fund software development:</p><ul><li><p>Crucial maintenance and technical development that <em>must</em> be perceived as vendor-neutral. If there is something fundamental to a tool, and that might be a leverage point for stakeholders to bias the project in their favor, foundations might fund a role that oversees technical development or direction in order to avoid the (real or perceived) bias towards whoever employs that developer.</p></li><li><p>Rotating roles for core project support and maintenance. Some projects fund a “developer in residence” type of role, which is a “chopping wood and carrying water” type of role to help projects do basic maintenance. I’ve seen this most-effectively used when a project has relatively few repositories or technical products (in my opinion, this would be hard to scale with Jupyter, which has dozens).</p></li><li><p>Special projects that have separate fundraising. For example, the Rust Foundation has a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://rustfoundation.org/security-initiative/" class="">security initiative</a> that I believe it does separate fundraising for. In this case, the “core foundation funds” cover the time of the people that <em>do the fundraising</em> for focused initiatives like this.</p></li></ul><div></div><section id="footnotes" class="article-grid subgrid-gap col-screen"><div><header class="text-lg font-semibold text-stone-900 dark:text-white group">Footnotes<a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit ml-2 select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#footnotes" title="Link to Footnotes" aria-label="Link to Footnotes">¶</a></header></div><div class="pl-3 mb-8 text-xs text-stone-500 dark:text-stone-300"><ol><li id="fn-os" class="group"><div class="flex flex-row"><div class="break-words grow"><p>You may be wondering: what about all those open source projects that companies put out all the time?
