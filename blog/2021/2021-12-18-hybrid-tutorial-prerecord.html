I’d stop the recording briefly for each section, take a quick breather, and then move on to recording the next.

Attendees would watch the pre-recorded video, and speak with me in the chat if anything came up.
This meant that I could address questions in real-time but without breaking up the flow of the tutorial.
If there was a really important question that was worth discussing as a group, I could have stopped the video to bring it up with everyone.</p><h2 id="thoughts" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Thoughts</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit px-2 font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#thoughts" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h2><p>In all, this worked really nicely!
The biggest downside is that it took a bit of extra time to pre-record the video before the talk itself.
However, I believe I might have actually <em>saved</em> time, because pre-recording the talk meant that I didn’t feel the need to tinker with my slides in the hours leading up to the talk.</p><p>Here are some of the benefits that I noticed:</p><ul><li>I could serve as presenter and assistant in one talk - two roles with one person!</li><li>It gave me more control over the talk length and pacing, because I <em>knew</em> how much total time was there.</li><li>By recording it ahead of time, I was “done” with the talk much earlier than I normally am (usually I’m stressing about slides until a few moments before the talk)</li><li>It also meant I had less anxiety before the event itself.</li></ul><p>I’ll give this another shot the next time I’m giving a remote tutorial (or maybe an in-person tutorial by myself).
In the meantime, I wanted to write up these thoughts while they were fresh in case this might work for somebody else.</p></div><div></div><div class="flex pt-10 mb-10 space-x-4"><a class="flex-1 block
