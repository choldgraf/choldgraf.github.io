keep track of the various projects they’re working on, and to prioritize their
time over the course of a week. I thought it might be helpful to post my own
approach to planning time throughout the week in case it’s useful for others to
riff off of.</p><h2 id="general-principles" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">General principles</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit px-2 font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#general-principles" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h2><p>First off, a few general principles that I use to guide my thinking on planning
out the week.</p><ol start="1"><li><strong>Be intentional.</strong> This seems obvious, but I find that if I don’t explicitly define
what I want to work on, I have more of those “where the heck did the day go” kinds
of weeks.</li><li><strong>Be strategic.</strong> There are only so many hours in the day, which means that I need to be
careful about what I commit to spending time on. I try to figure out what are the most
important things to do, and ensure I make space for this work before other stuff.</li><li><strong>Be (conservatively) realistic.</strong> I often get too optimistic with my time and energy levels.
Sometimes you’re tired, sometimes you get distracted, sometimes new work pops up you didn’t
account for. For this reason, I only budget about <strong>20 hours of diligent work a week</strong>.</li><li><strong>Be flexible.</strong> Finally, don’t worry about following the plan obsessively. Use it as a guide,
not a set of chains. If it’s worth re-prioritizing, that’s fine!</li><li><strong>Be diligent.</strong> That said, whenever the plans <em>do</em> change, make sure that this is written down
somewhere so that I know I’m being intentional about it.</li></ol><h2 id="what-tools-do-i-use" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">What tools do I use?</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit px-2 font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#what-tools-do-i-use" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h2><p>OK so what does this process actually look like? Here’s a general approach:</p><p>I use <a target="_blank" href="https://trello.com/" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Trello</strong></a> for managing most of the projects that I work on each week. For those who aren’t familiar,
Trello is a web app that lets you organize “cards” into vertical lists. It’s useful for Kanban-style
project management, and is super popular in technical circles.</p><p>I use two kinds of Trello boards, “project” boards, and my “weekly” board.</p><h2 id="project-boards" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Project boards</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit px-2 font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#project-boards" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h2><p>Project boards are project-specific. They’re organized in four primary columns.</p><ul><li><strong>Info</strong> has cards with information about that project. For example, links, notes, attachments, etc.</li><li><strong>ToDo</strong> has cards representing tasks that I’ll do eventually. These tend to be more abstract and
will evolve over time.</li><li><strong>Next</strong> has cards representing actionable tasks that I’ll do soon.</li><li><strong>Doing</strong> is a special list that I’ll explain later. It’s where cards go when I’m working on them currently.</li></ul><p>The other major component of the projcet board is a collection of “Done” lists. At the end of each
week, and cards that are finished get moved into a list named like so: <strong>Done - Week NN</strong> where “NN” is the
number of the current week.</p><p>I keep a short-list of currently-active projects that I’m working on. These are “starred” and show up at
the top of the Trello board list to the left.</p><p>Here’s an example of a project board:</p><img id="crSAP3eWDG" style="margin:0 auto" src="/build/trello-board-project-cf81a3068dcdb61684d38cc29576dbe5.png" data-canonical-url="../../images/2018/trello-board-project.png"/><h2 id="weekly-board" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Weekly board</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit px-2 font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#weekly-board" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h2><p>The other major Trello board that I use is my “weekly” board. This is basically a to-do list for my week.
It’s got one list per project, and each card represents a to-do item for that project. There is one-to-one
mapping between lists in this board and project boards that the cards come from.</p><p>As I work on cards throughout the week, I move them into another list called “Done”. Once the card is there,
it means that I’ve finished that task for the week.</p><p>An additional component is that each card is assigned a number of <strong>hours needed to complete the card</strong>.
I try to keep the total number of hours on this board to &lt;= 20. I’ve found that this is a realistic
balance between “enough hours to actually get stuff done” and “not so many hours that I won’t finish them”.</p><p>To assign and keep track of the hours with each card, I use a chrome extension called <a target="_blank" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/plus-for-trello-time-trac/gjjpophepkbhejnglcmkdnncmaanojkf?hl=en" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Plus for Trello</strong></a>. This
adds fields for “estimated” and “spent” hours that I update over the week.</p><p>Here’s an example of a weekly board:</p><img id="uCj8hy9D8g" style="margin:0 auto" src="/build/trello-board-active-c891b89ab2e4c176e80e238bd83b8a45.png" data-canonical-url="../../images/2018/trello-board-active.png"/><h2 id="how-does-this-work-in-practice" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">How does this work in practice?</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit px-2 font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#how-does-this-work-in-practice" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h2><p>I use a tool called <a target="_blank" href="https://butlerfortrello.com/" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Butler for Trello</strong></a> (BFT) to manage how cards flow through this system.
Lets you automate various tasks in Trello by writing messages that it parses as instructions.</p><p>Remember that “Doing” list that I mentioned in each project board? Any time I move a card into
a “Doing” list on a project board, the following happens:</p><ul><li>BFT adds a custom field to the card that has the Project Board ID that it came from</li><li>BFT moves the card to the “weekly” board, to a list with the same name as the project board</li></ul><p>Moreover, remember that there was a “Done” list in my weekly board? That also does something
special. I have a BFT link that, whenever clicked, does the following:</p><ul><li>Loop through every card in the “Done” list</li><li>For each card, find the Board ID that represents the board the card came from</li><li>Move the card to that board, put it in a “Done” list that is automatically created using the
number of the current active week.</li></ul><p>So, the general flow of cards through this system looks like this:</p><ol start="1"><li>Create cards in a project board that represent things to be done.</li><li>When it’s time to work on a task, move it to the “Doing” list</li><li>BFT moves that card to my “Weekly” board, to a list w/ the project name</li><li>This happens at the beginning of the week, along with an estimation of the time needed for
each card.</li><li>As the week progresses, I mark off the hours that I’ve spent on each card.</li><li>When the card’s hours remaining reaches 0, I move it to the “Done” list</li><li>At the end of the week, I click my “board cleanup” link, and it returns each card to its
original project board.</li><li>Next week, I repeat this cycle.</li></ol><p>And that’s about it - I’ve found that this process is a nice way to keep both a high-level
view of what needs to be done for my various projects (on each project board). It also allows
my to dig into specific to-do items throughout the week (on my weekly board).</p><p>I’d love to hear feedback and thoughts about how other people manage their time throughout
the week! Hopefully some of you all find this useful.</p><h2 id="extras" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Extras</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit px-2 font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#extras" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h2><p>Butler for Trello commands can be a little bit difficult to compose.
