# Sharing open grants publicly

Over the past few years, I've been trying to share more of my strategic and financial work publicly.
For example, [our recent JupyterHub grant for a Community Strategic Lead position](https://drive.google.com/file/d/124LWcFe8Hq2n_3l4jAgDgJ1lpXRzV1Kc/view) or a grant to [provide open cloud services for communities in Latin America and Africa](https://zenodo.org/record/7025288).
I've had a few people ask me about this process over the years, so I decided to write it up in a blog post.[^ttw]

[^ttw]: Many of the ideas in here are inspired by other communities. In particular [the Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/index.html) has a lot of great resources about doing work openly, collaboratively, and inclusively.

## Why share grants publicly

First off, here are a few reasons that I share grant narratives publicly:

- It is a reflection of my thinking and strategy at a moment in time, and nice for archival purposes. You never know when you want to refer to an old grant in generating new ideas.
- It makes the process of grantmaking more accessible to people that do not have the same experience and connections that I do.
- It helps attach these ideas to me as a professional, which is helpful for my professional goals and usually those of the grant team as well.
- It may inspire others to pursue similar efforts. Grants usually have high-level strategic ideas that I think are important, and making them more discoverable may inspire others to pursue these goals as well.
- It is a step towards making our communities more open and transparent, and a practice that I hope others will follow.

## A quick overview

Here's a quick overview of what I do when I submit a grant and wish to post it publicly.
I'll go into a bit more detail below.

- I ask for consent from others before sharing the grant
- I share the grant narrative, not the budgets
- I use [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) to create a DOI for the grant narrative
- I share the Zenodo link publicly and put it in my records

I'm still working out this practice, but the following sections are a few considerations from what I've learned in case they're helpful to others.
I'll try to keep this post updated if my approach substantially changes.

These steps trigger _after_ the grant is submitted.

## Ask for consent

First off, you need **consent from your grant team**.
This means anybody that significantly contributed to the grant text - you can define that however you like.
Make sure they are enthusiastic about your request to share the work publicly.

This can be a tricky subject for some, because sharing your work openly affects people in different ways depending on their career situation and personal comfort levels.
For some, sharing openly is percevied as a career boost, for others it might be perceived as a sacrifice that is too great.
Be understanding and generous in discussing with others, and do not post anything publicly if you don't have consent from all of your co-authors.

Next, you need **consent from the granting organization** to make sure they are OK with you sharing material publicly.
This is particularly important if the grant hasn't yet been decided upon, since your public posting might hurt their attempts at anonymizing applications.

I've never had a funder tell me _not_ to post grant narratives publicly, but I've also been fortunate to work with some amazing funders that share my values, so your mileage may vary.
In fact, most funders will help signal-boost your open grant once you share it.

## Decide what to share

This is a tricky one, because there are many kinds of information that go into a grant narrative - personal information, financial information, strategic information, etc.

Currently, I only try to share the **grant narrative** - the thing that explains the "who, what, why" of your grant.
This is because this is usually the most innovative or strategic aspect of the grant.

In a sense, grants make a case that _something is important_, and that _you want to do something specific about it_. The narrative is where you make this case, and sharing it publicly will help others understand your reasoning, and perhaps inspire them to follow your ideas.

I usually **create a second PDF of just the grant narrative** and share that.

I currently **do not** share financial and administrative information about the grant.
I still don't know how I feel about this, but my reasoning is this:

- Financial information is often more sensitive for the organizations involved, and thus can increase the amount of energy it takes to publish grants publicly. I'd rather have a public grant without a budget than not share a grant at all because it was too much political work to manage.
- Financial information is context-dependent, and may not necessarily be relevant to other organizations. For example, most of my grant budgets are for salary. If I'm applying via an organization in North America, salaries are going to be higher just because of the surrounding job market, not because it's inherently attached to the grant's ideas.[^1]

I still flip-flop on the question of budgets, and would love feedback from others about what they think.

[^1]: I think this changes if you actually _get_ the grant. If you're awarded funding that is earmarked for open causes, I think it's important to be transparent about what you're spending that money on.

## Give attribution to anyone that worked on the grant

You'll need to decide who to include in the grant's authorship and attribution list.
There are a lot of resources on this - for example, [see the Turing Way chapter on academic authorship](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/communication/aa/aa-overview.html).

That said, here's the approach I follow:

- Explicitly list anyone that _directly_ worked on the grant text itself (contributing text, proofreading, etc).
- Include _groups_ of people if they play a broader critical role in the grant's ideas (e.g. open source communities for a grant that is earmarked for them).
- Do whatever you can to signal-boost the people that come from a more disadvantaged position in the grant market. Their relative contribution might mean more to them.
- In general, err towards inclusion over exclusion. Err towards transparency and open dialogue over closed-room decisions.

## Use a DOI service that requires minimal energy

As with many "open" activities, sharing grants publicly requires extra work.
If it takes too much work, you'll end up not doing this at all.
**Make the process of sharing your grant as straightforward and low-effort as possible**.

My preference is to [use Zenodo.org](https://zenodo.org/), which will host your assets and give you a DOI for free.
Zenodo is a non-profit entity funded by CERN, and thus also follows better practices in good governance and public ownership than most other DOI-minting organizations.

The process is pretty simple, just:

- Go to `zenodo.org`
- Create an account (in my case, linked to [my `orcid` account](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2391-0678))
- Click on `Upload` -> `New Upload`.
- Drag and drop the narrative PDF.
- Fill out the metadata about the others that participated. Don't worry about getting all the summary details perfect if it will be a time sink.
- Click publish!

## Share with others

Finally, it is crucial that you actually _share_ the open narrative with others now that you've posted it publicly.
This is one of the most commonly-overlooked things that people don't do, but it is really important.
What's the point of making something public if nobody knows it exists?

Here are a few tips to follow:

- Store a link to the record in one or more public places. For example on your personal blog, keep a list of your open grants. Ask your organization if you can post it on their website. Try to choose a place you can refer to often.
- Ideally, write a short blog post about it. The post doesn't have to be long, just a few sentences summarizing **Why** you wrote the grant and **What** it's all about.
  This is because blog-posts are much more accessible and glanceable than grant proposals.
- Share it with others. Share links in forums and issues with communities that might be interested. Post it on social media like Mastodon and Twitter.

## I probably missed a bunch of stuff

Finally - this is just a quick overview of my current approach and thinking.
If I missed anything you think is important, please reach out and provide feedback!
I'll try and keep this updated as my approach evolves.
