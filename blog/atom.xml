    <title>Coherence correlation</title>
    <updated>2015-05-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note - you can find the nbviewer of this post &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/choldgraf/write-ups/blob/master/neuro/coherence_correlation.ipynb"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big question that I’ve always wrestled with is the difference between correlation and coherence. Intuitively, I think of these two things as very similar to one another. Correlation is a way to determine the extent to which two variables covary (normalized to be between -1 and 1). Coherence is similar, but instead assesses “similarity” by looking at the similarity for two variables in frequency space, rather than time space.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The beauty of computational efficiency</title>
    <updated>2016-07-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When we discuss “computational efficiency”, you often hear people throw around phrases like $O(n^2)$ or $O(nlogn)$. We talk about them in the abstract, and it can be hard to appreciate what these distinctions mean and how important they are. So let’s take a quick look at what computational efficiency looks like in the context of a very famous algorithm: The Fourier Transform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briefly, A Fourier Transform is used for uncovering the spectral information that is present in a signal. AKA, it tells us about oscillatory components in the signal, and has &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/69/why-is-the-fourier-transform-so-important"&gt;a wide range&lt;/a&gt; of uses in communications, signal processing, and even neuroscience analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Could Brexit have happened by chance?</title>
    <updated>2016-07-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As a scientist, watching the Brexit vote was a little bit painful. Though probably not for the reason you’re thinking. No, it wasn’t the politics that bothered me, but the method for making such an incredibly important decision. Let me explain…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists are a bit obsessed with the concept of error. In the context of collecting data and anaylzing it, this takes the form of our “confidence” in the results. If all the data say the same thing, then we are usually pretty confident in the overall message. If the data is more complicated than this (and it always is), then we need to define &lt;em&gt;how confident&lt;/em&gt; we are in our conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The bleeding edge of publishing, Scraping publication amounts at biorxiv</title>
    <updated>2016-12-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Per a recent request somebody posted on Twitter, I thought it’d be fun to write a quick scraper for the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://biorxiv.org/"&gt;biorxiv&lt;/a&gt;, an excellent new tool for posting pre-prints of articles before they’re locked down with a publisher embargo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big benefit of open science is the ability to use modern technologies (like web scraping) to make new use of data that would originally be unavailable to the public. One simple example of this is information and metadata about published articles.

    <title>Summer conference report back</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a short update on several of the conferences and workshops over the
summer of this year. There’s all kinds of exciting things going on in open
source and open communities, so this is a quick way for me to collect my

&lt;p&gt;Pangeo is a project that provides
&lt;strong&gt;access to a gigantic geosciences dataset&lt;/strong&gt;. They use lots of tools in the
open-source community, including Dask for efficient numerical computation,
the SciPy stack for a bunch of data analytics, and JupyterHub on
Kubernetes for managing user instances and deploying on remote infrastructure.
Pangeo has a neat demo of their hosted JupyterHub instance that people can use
to access this otherwise-inaccessible dataset! See their video from SciPy below.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Open communities need to be partners, not sources of free labor</title>
    <updated>2018-12-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the last couple of years, we’ve seen an increasing number of organizations start to
spawn products that take a largely open stack (e.g., the SciPy ecosystem) and wrap
it in a thin layer of proprietary/custom interface + infrastructure.
On the face of it, this isn’t a problem - I really want people to be able to
make money using the open source stack - however, there is a big caveat. When you look
at the work that those organizations have done over time, you often see a pretty thin trail
of contributions &lt;em&gt;back&lt;/em&gt; to those open source projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d argue that using an open community’s software without contributing back is straight-up
exploitative (legal, sure, but still exploitative), and we should think about ways to
suppress this kind of behavior. This post is a collection of thoughts on that topic.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;tl;dr: you can automatically mirror the contents of one repository to another by
using CI/CD services like CircleCI. This post shows you one way to do it using
secrets that let you push to a GitHub repository from a CircleCI process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recently ran into an issue with the Data 8 course where we needed to mirror
one GitHub site to another. In short, the textbook is built with a tool called
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://predictablynoisy.com/jupyter-book/intro.html"&gt;jupyter-book&lt;/a&gt;, and we use &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pages.github.com/"&gt;github-pages&lt;/a&gt;
to host the content at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://inferentialthinking.com"&gt;inferentialthinking.com&lt;/a&gt;.
For &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://help.github.com/articles/custom-domain-redirects-for-github-pages-sites/"&gt;weird URL-naming reasons&lt;/a&gt;,
we had to create &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/inferentialthinking/inferentialthinking.github.io"&gt;a second organization&lt;/a&gt;
to host the actual site. This introduced the complexity that any time the textbook
had to be updated, we did so in &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; different places. The raw textbook content
is hosted at https://github.com/data-8/textbook, and the version hosted online is
at https://github.com/inferentialthinking/inferentialthinking.github.io.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Lately I’ve spent a lot of time trying to reduce the friction involved
in deploying Jupyter Book as well as contributing to the project.
Features are a great carrot, but ultimately getting engagement is also
about lowering barriers to entry and showing people a path forward.
Jupyter Book is a relatively straightforward project, but it involves
a few technical pieces that can be painful to use (thanks Jekyll).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I experimented with whether we can &lt;strong&gt;automate deploying a Jupyter Book online&lt;/strong&gt;.
Using continuous integration / deployment services seems like a natural place
to try this out. One can upload a barebones set of code to a GitHub repository,
then configure a build system to create a book and deploy it online from there.
This blog post is a place to keep track of the current state of affairs for this workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is common in neuroscience to ask individuals to perform a task over and over again. You record
the activity in the brain each time they perform the task (called an “epoch” or a “trial”).
Time is recorded relative to some &lt;em&gt;onset&lt;/em&gt; when the task begins. That is &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;t==0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. The result
is usually a matrix of &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;epochs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;channejupyls&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. You can do a lot of stuff with this
data, but our task in this paper is to detect changes in neural activity at trial onset (&lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;t==0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>Over the last few years, it has been exciting to see the xarray project evolve,
add new functionality, and mature. This post is an attempt at
giving xarray another visit to see how it could integrate into electrophysiology
workflows.It is common in neuroscience to ask individuals to perform a task over and over again. You record
the activity in the brain each time they perform the task (called an “epoch” or a “trial”).
Time is recorded relative to some onset when the task begins. That is t==0. The result
is usually a matrix of epochs x channejupyls x time. You can do a lot of stuff with this
data, but our task in this paper is to detect changes in neural activity at trial onset (t==0).</summary>

    <title>What would Python-style governance look like in Jupyter?</title>
    <updated>2019-10-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is the second in a series of blog posts that explores what it’d look like to
directly port the governance model of other communities into the Jupyter project.
You can find the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://predictablynoisy.com/rust-jupyter-governance"&gt;first post about Rust here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: These posts are meant as a thought experiment rather than a proposal. Moreover,
all the usual caveats come with it, such as the
fact that I don’t know the Python governance
structure &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; well, and I might totally
botch my characterization of it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For several months now, the universal &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pandoc.org/"&gt;document converter pandoc&lt;/a&gt; has
had &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#creating-jupyter-notebooks-with-pandoc"&gt;support for Jupyter Notebooks&lt;/a&gt;. This means that with a single call,
you can convert &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;.ipynb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; files to any of the output formats that Pandoc
supports (and vice-versa!). This post is a quick exploration of what this
looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note that for this post, we’re using Pandoc version 2.7.3&lt;/strong&gt;. Also, some of what’s below is hard
to interpret without actually opening the files that are created by Pandoc. For the sake
of this blog post, I’m going to stick with the raw text output here, though you can expand the
outputs if you wish, I recommend copy/pasting some of these commands on your own if you’d like to try.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What do people think about rST?</title>
    <updated>2020-01-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Publishing computational narratives has always been a dream of the Jupyter Project,
and there is still a lot of work to be done in improving these use-cases. We’ve made
a lot of progress in providing open infrastructure for reproducible science with
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/"&gt;JupyterHub&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://mybinder.org/"&gt;the Binder Project&lt;/a&gt;, but what about the documents themselves?
We’ve recently been working on tools like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://jupyterbook.org"&gt;Jupyter Book&lt;/a&gt;,
which aim to improve the writing and publishing process with the Jupyter ecosystem.
This is hopefully the first post of a few that ask how we can best-improve the state
of publishing with Jupyter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the ideas in this post have now made their way into a new flavor of markdown called &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io"&gt;Markedly Structured Text&lt;/a&gt;, or MyST. It brings all of the features of rST into Markdown. Check it out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether it is because of altruism or strategic importance, many companies, research groups, non-profits, etc &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to be involved in open source projects (particularly large and impactful ones like Jupyter), but getting involved can be an opaque and confusing process if you’re not already familiar with open source. Each community has its own nuances and social dynamics, and approaching from the outside can be a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
