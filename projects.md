The International Interactive Computing Collaboration is a non-profit organization dedicated to developing and providing infrastructure for interactive computing in research and education. It is an attempt at providing sustainable, vendor-agnostic, and open infrastructure that maximizes flexibility, choice, and productivity for research and education.

[Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org) is an open source project for building beautiful, publication-quality books and documents from computational material.

It is stewarded by the [Executable Books Project](https://executablebooks.org), an international collaboration to build open-source tools that facilitate publishing computational narratives using the Jupyter ecosystem.

Binder allows you to create custom computing environments that can be
shared and used by many remote users. It is powered by BinderHub,
an open-source tool to deploy the Binder service in the cloud.
One such deployment lives at [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org),
where it is run as a free service.

The goal of Binder is to enable people to share reproducible, interactive versions
of their code with others as easily as possible. It is used by people across
the scientific, education, and analytics communities.

JupyterHub is a tool that lets an administrator serve many user sessions
from a single machine. The [Zero to JupyterHub guide](https://z2jh.jupyter.org) is an instructional and
opinionated guide to deploying a JupyterHub on Kubernetes, a framework for
deploying / managing cloud resources.

The Zero to JupyterHub guide was originally written as an extension of
the technical infrastructure for UC Berkeley's Data 8 course, and since then
has become the most popular method for running a JupyterHub at scale in the cloud.

The Docathon is a week-long global sprint where we focus our efforts on
improving the state of documentation in the open-source and open-science
world. This means writing better documentation, building tools,
and sharing skills.

The first Docathon was held in 2017, and had participants from across the globe.

More than 40 open-source projects contributed, and in total we put out a
roughly ten-fold increase in contributions to documentation over the week!

MNE-Python is open-source software for exploring, visualizing, and analyzing
human neurophysiological data (MEG, EEG, sEEG, ECoG, etc).

After my PhD, I spent some time generalizing the code I had written for [receptive field
analysis](https://martinos.org/mne/stable/auto_tutorials/plot_receptive_field.html?highlight=receptive%20field)
of human ECoG data, which now exists in MNE-Python.
