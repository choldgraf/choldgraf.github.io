Fortunately, after some urging from friends and social media, I took a deeper look and decided I should join to see what all the fuss was about.

Sphinx is great because it has a ton of useful extensions that let you grow its functionality.
However, a downside of this is that users have to actually _learn about_ those extensions and activate them manually.
It&#x27;s not hard, but it&#x27;s a non-trivial amount of discovery work.

One way to solve this is</p></div><footer class="py-1 pl-3 m-0 border-t border-gray-100 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-slate-900 dark:border-gray-800"><strong>Date: </strong>January 19, 2023 | <strong>Author: </strong>Chris Holdgraf</footer></a><a class="my-5 rounded shadow dark:shadow-neutral-800 overflow-hidden border border-gray-100 dark:border-gray-800 flex flex-col text-inherit hover:text-inherit block font-normal no-underline hover:no-underline cursor-pointer group hover:border-blue-500 dark:hover:border-blue-400" href="/blog/2022/install-github-from-pyproject"><div class="flex-grow px-4 py-2"><div class="pt-3 font-bold group-hover:underline">Install dependencies from GitHub with `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt`</div><p>


This is a short post to demonstrate how to install packages directly from GitHub with `pyprojects.toml` or `requirements.txt`, including custom branches and commits.
It will focus on `pyprojects.toml` because this is newer and there&#x27;s less information about it, but the general pattern holds for `requirements.txt` as well.

However, Roboto is often not loaded on your local filesystem, so it took some digging to figure out how to make it possible to load via [Matplotlib&#x27;s text plotting functionality](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.text.html).

I figured out a way to automatically update all of the git `pre-commit` hook versions at once!

[`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) is a useful command line tool for running simple commands before every `git` commit.
I use it to enforce things like [`flake8`](https://flake8.pycqa.org/) and [`black`](https://github.com/psf/black) in many of my projects.

However, I find it really annoying</p></div><footer class="py-1 pl-3 m-0 border-t border-gray-100 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-slate-900 dark:border-gray-800"><strong>Date: </strong>December 03, 2022 | <strong>Author: </strong>Chris Holdgraf</footer></a><a class="my-5 rounded shadow dark:shadow-neutral-800 overflow-hidden border border-gray-100 dark:border-gray-800 flex flex-col text-inherit hover:text-inherit block font-normal no-underline hover:no-underline cursor-pointer group hover:border-blue-500 dark:hover:border-blue-400" href="/blog/2022/shell-split"><div class="flex-grow px-4 py-2"><div class="pt-3 font-bold group-hover:underline">`subprocess.run` can execute shell commands directly</div><p>


I often run shell commands in Python via the [`subprocess.run` command](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.run).
One thing that has always bugged me is that this required you to split commands into a list before it&#x27;d work properly.
For example, you&#x27;d have to do:

```python
import subprocess
import shlex

subprocess.run(*shlex.split(&quot;ls -l&quot;))
```

Today I discovered that you don&#x27;t have to do this!
There&#x27;s a</p></div><footer class="py-1 pl-3 m-0 border-t border-gray-100 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-slate-900 dark:border-gray-800"><strong>Date: </strong>November 29, 2022 | <strong>Author: </strong>Chris Holdgraf</footer></a><a class="my-5 rounded shadow dark:shadow-neutral-800 overflow-hidden border border-gray-100 dark:border-gray-800 flex flex-col text-inherit hover:text-inherit block font-normal no-underline hover:no-underline cursor-pointer group hover:border-blue-500 dark:hover:border-blue-400" href="/blog/2022/phantom-workflows-pull-requests"><div class="flex-grow px-4 py-2"><div class="pt-3 font-bold group-hover:underline">Fix phantom GitHub workflows in your ci-cd with protected branch rules</div><p>


Have you ever had a GitHub pull request show &quot;phantom&quot; workflows that never pass?
This looks like one or more workflows that are in a constant **waiting state**, with a yellow status indicator, and that never complete.

It looks something like this:

```

If you run into this, it may be because of</p></div><footer class="py-1 pl-3 m-0 border-t border-gray-100 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-slate-900 dark:border-gray-800"><strong>Date: </strong>November 27, 2022 | <strong>Author: </strong>Chris Holdgraf</footer></a><a class="my-5 rounded shadow dark:shadow-neutral-800 overflow-hidden border border-gray-100 dark:border-gray-800 flex flex-col text-inherit hover:text-inherit block font-normal no-underline hover:no-underline cursor-pointer group hover:border-blue-500 dark:hover:border-blue-400" href="/blog/2022/sphinx-custom-crossrefs"><div class="flex-grow px-4 py-2"><div class="pt-3 font-bold group-hover:underline">Custom roles and domains in Sphinx with one line</div><p>


I was working on [the roles and structure section of the 2i2c Team Compass](https://compass.2i2c.org) and found a nifty feature in Sphinx that I hadn&#x27;t known before.

You can currently add labels to any section with the following MyST Markdown structure:

```md
(mylabel)=

And now I [reference it](mylabel).
```

However, there are no **semantics** attached to this</p></div><footer class="py-1 pl-3 m-0 border-t border-gray-100 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-slate-900 dark:border-gray-800"><strong>Date: </strong>November 21, 2022 | <strong>Author: </strong>Chris Holdgraf</footer></a><a class="my-5 rounded shadow dark:shadow-neutral-800 overflow-hidden border border-gray-100 dark:border-gray-800 flex flex-col text-inherit hover:text-inherit block font-normal no-underline hover:no-underline cursor-pointer group hover:border-blue-500 dark:hover:border-blue-400" href="/blog/2022/sphinx-redirects-folder"><div class="flex-grow px-4 py-2"><div class="pt-3 font-bold group-hover:underline">Automatically redirect folders in Sphinx websites</div><p>


I spent a bit of time today updating my website after some changes in the MyST-NB and Sphinx Design ecosystems.
Along the way, I decided to redirect `/posts/` to `/blog/`, since it seems `/blog/` is a much more common folder to use for blog posts.

This posed a problem, because [the `sphinx-rediraffe`</p></div><footer class="py-1 pl-3 m-0 border-t border-gray-100 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-slate-900 dark:border-gray-800"><strong>Date: </strong>November 19, 2022 | <strong>Author: </strong>Chris Holdgraf</footer></a><a class="my-5 rounded shadow dark:shadow-neutral-800 overflow-hidden border border-gray-100 dark:border-gray-800 flex flex-col text-inherit hover:text-inherit block font-normal no-underline hover:no-underline cursor-pointer group hover:border-blue-500 dark:hover:border-blue-400" href="/blog/2022/orcid-auto-update"><div class="flex-grow px-4 py-2"><div class="pt-3 font-bold group-hover:underline">Automatically updating my publications page with ORCID and doi.org</div><p>


For a while I&#x27;ve had a hand-crafted `.bibtex` file stored locally for [my `publications/` page](../../publications.md).
However, manually updating local text file is a pain to remember, especially since there are many services out there that automatically track new publications.

At AGU 2021 this year I was asked to give [a short tutorial introduction to Jupyter Book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZ2FHTkyaMU).
The tutorial was 30 minutes long, and the session was fully remote.

This posed a few challenges:

- Tutorials almost **always** go over time - particularly if you&#x27;re taking questions from attendees.
- It is tricky to</p></div><footer class="py-1 pl-3 m-0 border-t border-gray-100 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-slate-900 dark:border-gray-800"><strong>Date: </strong>December 17, 2021 | <strong>Author: </strong>Chris Holdgraf</footer></a><a class="my-5 rounded shadow dark:shadow-neutral-800 overflow-hidden border border-gray-100 dark:border-gray-800 flex flex-col text-inherit hover:text-inherit block font-normal no-underline hover:no-underline cursor-pointer group hover:border-blue-500 dark:hover:border-blue-400" href="/blog/2020/organizations-help-oss-guide"><div class="flex-grow px-4 py-2"><div class="pt-3 font-bold group-hover:underline">Contributing to open source: A short guide for organizations</div><p>

I&#x27;m building my blog with the [MyST Markdown engine](https://mystmd.org) now, which means that all of this sphinx-specific stuff probably doesn&#x27;t work anymore :-)

Publishing computational narratives has always been a dream of the Jupyter Project,
and there is still a lot of work to be done in improving these use-cases. We&#x27;ve made
a lot of progress in providing open infrastructure for reproducible science with
[JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and
[the Binder Project](https://mybinder.org/), but what about the documents themselves?
