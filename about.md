# About me

I'm a post-doc in the Statistics department at UC Berkeley, and a co-founder of the [non-profit 2i2c](https://2i2c.org).

**Scientific Research and Open Scholarship**

:column: col-9

I used to study cognitive and computational neuroscience, using predictive modeling to study the ways in which the human auditory system understands speech.

- A good example of my work is this paper about [{fa}`file-alt`top-down speech representations influencing the perception of noisy speech](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13654).
- To learn about these methods, see my methods paper about [{fa}`file-alt` encoding and decoding models of speech perception](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2017.00061/full).

I've also been involved with several projects across other fields in academic / scientific research, especially "meta" issues in open source communities and open standards and practices in scientific fields.

For a list of publications and scholarly artifacts in which I've been involved,

**Open Source and Open Community**

---
:column: col-9

I work on projects that make research and education more effective, efficient, inclusive, and transparent. I also believe that it's important for open source technical projects to have healthy and inclusive _communities_ behind them.

I contribute to a number of open-source projects that support the research and education community. In particular I am a core contributor to many projects in the [PyData ecosystem](https://numfocus.org/sponsored-projects), and in particular the following major projects:

- [Project Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) - an open platform and community for interactive data science.
- [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub) - shared infrastructure for interactive computing on shared infrastructure.
- [the Binder Project](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about.html) - tools and standards for interactive, reproducible, sharable repositories.
- [the Executable Books Project](https://executablebooks.org) - open source tools that facilitate publishing computational narratives using the Jupyter ecosystem.

If you want a hard-copy CV, you can find a {download}`reasonably up-to-date CV here </_static/cv.pdf>`.

## About this website

This is an experiment in hosting my personal website and blog via Sphinx extensions instead of using Jekyll. It uses the [pydata sphinx theme](https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/) along with [ablog](https://ablog.readthedocs.io/) for blogging, and the [myst-parser](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [myst-nb](https://myst-nb.readthedocs.io/) packages for writing posts in Markdown and Jupyter Notebooks.
