There’s the hard part. But the short answer is that we could include some idea of random variability in our voting rules. For example, we could require that this kind of “should we deviate from the norm” decision exceeds the results expected from a totally random vote. Settling on this uncertainty limit is not a simple task, but then again I wouldn’t want to bet 2 trillion dollars worth of global economy on a coin flip.","position":{"start":{"line":8,"column":1},"end":{"line":8,"column":1}},"key":"KizwFwqVNe"}],"key":"GJWeGSFV6a"}],"key":"I8Iw8h2eIW"},{"type":"block","kind":"notebook-content","data":{"collapsed":true},"children":[{"type":"heading","depth":2,"position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1},"end":{"line":1,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Extra: Adding a short term swing","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1},"end":{"line":1,"column":1}},"key":"OsVd9Ws7W9"}],"identifier":"extra-adding-a-short-term-swing","label":"Extra: Adding a short term swing","html_id":"extra-adding-a-short-term-swing","implicit":true,"key":"ykKtGjUJwu"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":2,"column":1},"end":{"line":2,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"As I mentioned above, deciding how to simulate the votes involves making assumptions about how things will go.
