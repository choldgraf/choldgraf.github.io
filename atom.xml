Last week I took a few days to attend [DevOpsDays Silicon Valley](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2018-silicon-valley/program/). My goal
was to learn a bit about how the DevOps culture works, what are the things
people are excited about and discuss in this community. I'm also interested in

Here's a quick (and hopefully helpful) post for those wishing to blog in
Jekyll using Jupyter notebooks. As some of you may know, `nbconvert` can
easily convert your `.ipynb` files to markdown, which Jekyll can easily
turn into blog posts for you.

```

```

However, an annoying part of this is that Markdown</content>

How do open projects signal their "openness" to the outside community? This is
a really hard question, particularly because nowadays "open" has become a buzzword
that doesn't just signal a project's position to the community, but is also used
as a marketing term to increase support, users, or resources.

As I've written about before, I [like Rust's governance structure](https://chrisholdgraf.com/rust-governance).
I mean, who can't get behind a community that
[lists governance as a top-level page on its website](https://www.rust-lang.org/governance)?

Jupyter is currently in the middle of
[figuring out the next phase of its governance structure](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/governance-office-hours-meeting-minutes/1480/26),
and so I have been thinking about
what this might look like.</content>

Have you ever had a GitHub pull request show "phantom" workflows that never pass?
This looks like one or more workflows that are in a constant **waiting state**, with a yellow status indicator, and that never complete.

I often run shell commands in Python via the [`subprocess.run` command](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.run).
One thing that has always bugged me is that this required you to split commands into a list before it'd work properly.
For example, you'd have to do:

```python
import subprocess
import shlex

subprocess.run(*shlex.split("ls -l"))
```

    <title>How to update Sphinx options during the build</title>

As part of [the `pydata-sphinx-theme`](https://github.com/pydata/pydata-sphinx-theme/pull/1075) we have a few settings that auto-enable extensions and configure them on behalf of the user.
It has always been mysterious to me how to do this properly **during the Sphinx build**.
It's easy to configure things with `conf.py` ahead of time, but what if you want</content>

As part of [my `sphinx-social-previews`](https://github.com/choldgraf/sphinx-social-previews) prototype, I wanted to be able to use the [Roboto Font from Google](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) in image previews.
However, Roboto is often not loaded on your local filesystem, so it took some digging to figure out how to make it possible to load via [Matplotlib's text plotting functionality](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.text.html).

This is a short post to demonstrate how to install packages directly from GitHub with `pyprojects.toml` or `requirements.txt`, including custom branches and commits.
It will focus on `pyprojects.toml` because this is newer and there's less information about it, but the general pattern holds for `requirements.txt` as well.

In `pyproject.toml`, you can specify</content>

Sphinx is great because it has a ton of useful extensions that let you grow its functionality.
However, a downside of this is that users have to actually _learn about_ those extensions and activate them manually.
It's not hard, but it's a non-trivial amount of discovery work.

One way to solve this is</content>

I recently attended [FOSDEM 2023](https://fosdem.org/2023/), my first FOSDEM!
I had heard of the conference before, but hadn't really looked into it too much.
Fortunately, after some urging from friends and social media, I took a deeper look and decided I should join to see what all the fuss was about.

I've since moved my blog to use [the MyST Document Engine](https://mystmd.org) so this example will no longer work on my personal blog.

While I've been [converting my blog to use the new MyST engine](./mystmd-with-the-blog.md), I discovered a useful MyST feature. It's not yet possible to [natively parse Jupyter Markdown outputs as MyST](https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd/issues/1026) but there's a workaround if you don't mind generating a temporary file.

The trick is to _write to a temporary file_</content>
